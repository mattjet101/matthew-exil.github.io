                Hello! My name is Matthew Exil. I am currently a Computer Engineering freshman at NJIT with an expected graduation date in 2023. 
                I enjoy learning new concepts, video games, listening to music (Neo-Soul is my favorite genre), and meeting new people! 
                Below are means of contacting me as I continue to develop new projects and update with website.
