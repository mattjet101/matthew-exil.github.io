    <p style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Matthew Exil. I am currently a Computer Engineering freshman at NJIT with an expected graduation date in 2023. I enjoy learning new concepts, video games, listening to music (Neo-Soul is my favorite genre), and meeting new people! Below are means of contacting me as I continue to develop new projects and update with website. </p>
